- :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: **You will use this information to log in as an administrator.**

```C#
var admin = new User()
{
     Id = 1,
     FirstName = "Bill", //Enter your first name
     LastName = "Tomson", //Enter your last name
     Email = "Example@gmail.com", //Enter your email
     Age = 33, //Enter your age
     Password = HashingService.GetHashString("12345Qwerty"), //Enter your password in GetHashString("....")
     RoleId = adminRole.Id
};
```
- Now we can do the migration and init the database. To do this, we need to open `Package Manager Console` and in turn enter `Add-migration [name of migration]` , `Update-database`. After that, you will create a migrations folder, as well as all the tables in the database.
